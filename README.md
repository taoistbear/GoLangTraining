# My Golang Journey
## This is my training/notes/exercises from Todd McLeod's online Golang training

As a note... this material with the exception of my exercise solutions came from
Todd Mcleod. I may have added notes for myself, yet this is how I learn. I type
it all out myself and then review his videos and take notes. If you wish to
learn go Udemy and Science Alert has Todd's GoLang Training Course and I highly
reccomend it.
